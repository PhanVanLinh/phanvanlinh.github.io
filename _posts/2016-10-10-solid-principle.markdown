### **Single responsibility principle**

>One class should do one thing

### **Open/closed principle**

>Able to expand a class, but don't edit

When we need to add new fucntions for application, we should extend old class by inherit or hold this class in new class, shouldn't edit old class directly. This will make our project have more class but we don't need to test old class, just need to test new class with new function.

### **Liskov substitution principle**

### **Interface segregation principle**

>Instead of using big interface with various methods, we should split it to multiple interface

### **Dependency inversion principle**
