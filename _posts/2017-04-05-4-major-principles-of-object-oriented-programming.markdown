## 4 major princple

### Inheritance
Example: Child class extends from Parent class and implement Interface  

### Encapsulation
 Wrapping up of data and methods into a single unit is Encapsulation. In a class we combine data(variables ) and method that are operated on that data. (e.g. Class)  
  
### Abstraction
It is an act of representing only the essential things without including background details. Like we are providing only method declaration in interface not method body (e.g. Interface)  

### Polymorphism

Example method have same name but do different thing (eg:  Override and overload method)
